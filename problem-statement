1️⃣ Spring Boot app sends metrics, logs, and traces to OTEL Collector
 2️⃣ OTEL Collector forwards metrics to Prometheus , Prometheus should use mimir for scaling metric storage layer 
 3️⃣ OTEL Collector forwards traces to Tempo backed by S3 
 4️⃣ OTEL Collector forwards logs to Loki backed by S3 
 5️⃣ Grafana queries Prometheus (metrics), Tempo (traces), and Loki (logs) 
 React requests should be tracable from client side back to server , 
 full cycle Spring webflux app may talk to grpc which should be in the trace for the same request (transaction) 
 I want every details in my observability dashboard , all real life metrics , 
 log and traces that high value companies do, including slow queries , 
 error threshold , HTTP 200 , 400 , 500 and other important status code oversabation . response time , 
 file descriptors , request queue time , queue length, db connection pool , everything .. 
 you know all standard metrics and dashboard . All needs to be docker based and locally deployable using docker and 
 testable and demo able. except the s3 part .
